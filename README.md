I want to bring Spear and DAWs possibilities inside the OM.

This library is part of my Ph.D. at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. I hope to understand the relationship between the visual-programming and compositional work in a cognitive way. To understand this process, I will use the FFT.

### The Use of VST2 in OpenMusic and OM#


I implemented the possibility of using VST2 within OM-Sharp and OM (not all ready yet). For that, I am using **[MrsWatson](https://github.com/teragonaudio/MrsWatson)**.
